// A non-binary line SHOULD BE terminated by an LF, which if present MUST be included in the total length.
// Receivers MUST treat pkt-lines with non-binary data the same whether or not they contain the trailing LF (stripping the LF if present, and not complaining when it is missing).
//
// The maximum length of a pkt-lineâ€™s data component is 65516 bytes.
// Implementations MUST NOT send pkt-line whose length exceeds 65520 (65516 bytes of payload + 4 bytes of length data).
//
// A pkt-line with a length field of 0 ("0000"), called a flush-pkt, is a special case and MUST be handled differently than an empty pkt-line ("0004").
