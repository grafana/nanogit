## Overview

nanogit is a lightweight, cloud-native Git implementation designed for applications that need efficient Git operations over HTTPS without the complexity and resource overhead of traditional Git implementations.

## Features

- **HTTPS-only Git operations** - Works with any Git service supporting Smart HTTP Protocol v2 (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.), eliminating the need for SSH key management in cloud environments

- **Stateless architecture** - No local .git directory dependency, making it perfect for serverless functions, containers, and microservices where persistent local state isn't available or desired

- **Memory-optimized design** - Streaming packfile operations and configurable writing modes minimize memory usage, crucial for bulk operations and memory-constrained environments

- **Flexible storage architecture** - Pluggable object storage and configurable writing modes allow optimization for different deployment patterns, from high-performance in-memory operations to memory-efficient disk-based processing

- **Cloud-native authentication** - Built-in support for Basic Auth and API tokens, designed for automated workflows and CI/CD systems without interactive authentication

- **Essential Git operations** - Focused on core functionality (read/write objects, commit operations, diffing) without the complexity of full Git implementations, reducing attack surface and resource requirements

- **High performance** - Significantly faster than traditional Git implementations for common cloud operations, with up to 300x speed improvements for certain scenarios

## Non-Goals

The following features are explicitly not supported:

- `git://` and Git-over-SSH protocols
- File protocol (local Git operations)
- Commit signing and signature verification
- Git hooks
- Git configuration management
- Direct .git directory access
- "Dumb" servers
- Complex permissions (all objects use mode 0644)

## Why nanogit?

While [go-git](https://github.com/go-git/go-git) is a mature Git implementation, nanogit is designed for cloud-native, multitenant environments requiring minimal, stateless operations.

| Feature        | nanogit                                                | go-git                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Protocol       | HTTPS-only                                             | All protocols          |
| Storage        | Stateless, configurable object storage + writing modes | Local disk operations  |
| Cloning        | Path filtering with glob patterns, shallow clones      | Full repository clones |
| Scope          | Essential operations only                              | Full Git functionality |
| Use Case       | Cloud services, multitenant                            | General purpose        |
| Resource Usage | Minimal footprint                                      | Full Git features      |

Choose nanogit for lightweight cloud services requiring stateless operations and minimal resources. Use go-git when you need full Git functionality, local operations, or advanced features.

This are some of the performance differences between nanogit and go-git in some of the measured scenarios:

| Scenario                                  | Speed       | Memory Usage |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| CreateFile (XL repo)                      | 306x faster | 186x less    |
| UpdateFile (XL repo)                      | 291x faster | 178x less    |
| DeleteFile (XL repo)                      | 302x faster | 175x less    |
| BulkCreateFiles (1000 files, medium repo) | 607x faster | 11x less     |
| CompareCommits (XL repo)                  | 60x faster  | 96x less     |
| GetFlatTree (XL repo)                     | 258x faster | 160x less    |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later.
- Git (for development)

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/grafana/nanogit
```

### Usage

```go
// Create client with authentication
client, err := nanogit.NewHTTPClient(
    "https://github.com/user/repo.git",
    options.WithBasicAuth("username", "token"),
)

// Get main branch and create staged writer
ref, err := client.GetRef(ctx, "refs/heads/main")
writer, err := client.NewStagedWriter(ctx, ref)

// Create and update files
writer.CreateBlob(ctx, "docs/new-feature.md", []byte("# New Feature"))
writer.UpdateBlob(ctx, "README.md", []byte("Updated content"))

// Commit changes with proper author/committer info
author := nanogit.Author{
    Name:  "John Doe",
    Email: "john@example.com",
    Time:  time.Now(),
}
committer := nanogit.Committer{
    Name:  "Deploy Bot",
    Email: "deploy@example.com",
    Time:  time.Now(),
}

commit, err := writer.Commit(ctx, "Add feature and update docs", author, committer)
writer.Push(ctx)
```

### Cloning Repositories with Path Filtering

nanogit provides efficient cloning with flexible path filtering, ideal for CI environments where only specific directories are needed:

```go
// First, get the commit hash for the branch you want to clone
ref, err := client.GetRef(ctx, "main")
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// Clone specific directories only (perfect for CI with no caching)
result, err := client.Clone(ctx, nanogit.CloneOptions{
    Path:         "/tmp/my-repo",        // Local filesystem path (required)
    Hash:         ref.Hash,              // Commit hash (required)
    IncludePaths: []string{"src/**", "docs/**"}, // Include only these paths
    ExcludePaths: []string{"*.tmp", "node_modules/**"}, // Exclude these paths
})
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// result.Commit contains the commit information
// result.FlatTree contains filtered file tree
// Files are automatically written to result.Path
fmt.Printf("Cloned %d of %d files to %s\n",
    result.FilteredFiles, result.TotalFiles, result.Path)
```

Key clone features:

- **Path filtering**: Use glob patterns to include/exclude specific files and directories
- **Filesystem output**: Automatically writes filtered files to specified local path
- **Shallow clones**: Fetch only the latest commit to minimize bandwidth
- **Branch isolation**: Clone only specific branches to reduce transfer time
- **CI optimized**: Perfect for build environments with no persistent storage

### Configurable Writing Modes

nanogit provides flexible writing modes to optimize memory usage during write operations:

```go
// Auto mode (default) - smart memory/disk switching
writer, err := client.NewStagedWriter(ctx, ref)

// Memory mode - maximum performance
writer, err := client.NewStagedWriter(ctx, ref, nanogit.WithMemoryStorage())

// Disk mode - minimal memory usage for bulk operations
writer, err := client.NewStagedWriter(ctx, ref, nanogit.WithDiskStorage())
```

For detailed information about writing modes, performance characteristics, and use cases, see [Storage Architecture Documentation](STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Storage Architecture

nanogit features a flexible two-layer storage architecture that separates concerns and allows independent optimization:

1. **Writing modes**: Control temporary storage during packfile creation (memory/disk/auto)
2. **Object storage**: Handle long-term caching and retrieval of Git objects (pluggable backends)

### Object Storage and Caching

nanogit provides context-based object storage with pluggable backends. The default in-memory implementation is optimized for stateless operations, but you can implement custom backends for persistent caching:

```go
// Custom storage example
ctx = storage.ToContext(ctx, myRedisStorage)
client, err := nanogit.NewHTTPClient(repo, options...)
```

This enables sharing Git object cache across multiple repositories, persistent caching across service restarts, and optimization for specific deployment patterns.

For detailed information about storage architecture, writing modes, and custom implementations, see [Storage Architecture Documentation](STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Testing

nanogit includes generated mocks for easy unit testing. The mocks are generated using [counterfeiter](https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter) and provide comprehensive test doubles for both the `Client` and `StagedWriter` interfaces.

For detailed testing examples and instructions, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-with-mocks). You can also find complete working examples in [mocks/example_test.go](mocks/example_test.go).
