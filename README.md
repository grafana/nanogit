# nanogit

A limited, cloud-ready Git implementation for use in Grafana.

## Maintenance

This project is not maintained. It was created as part of a hackathon, and as
such is not intended as a real Grafana product, nor in any way or shape or form
intended for production.

## Graduation

If the project is intended to be graduated to a proper OSS project, you should
just replace `hackathon-2024-12-nanogit` with `nanogit` everywhere. Tools like
[sd](https://github.com/chmln/sd) can be of help.

Make sure someone owns and maintains this project if you intend on graduating
it. Otherwise, we may gain security vulnerabilities which we won't solve.
